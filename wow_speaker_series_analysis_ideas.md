# WOW Speaker Series Data Analysis Ideas

Based on the structure and content of "WOW Speaker Series data by session.XLS", here are 25+ specific analysis ideas you can explore across the different sheets.

## Attendance & Engagement Analysis

1. **Cross-Session Attendance Patterns**: Identify individuals who attended multiple speaker sessions and analyze which combinations of sessions were most common. Create a Venn diagram showing overlap between sessions.

2. **Attendance by Constituency**: Compare the distribution of constituency codes (alumni, faculty/staff, etc.) across different speaker sessions to identify which sessions attracted which audience segments.

3. **Greek Affiliation Analysis**: Analyze whether certain speaker sessions attracted more attendees from specific Greek organizations and if there are patterns in which sororities/fraternities attend which types of events.

4. **Attendance by Graduation Decade**: Group attendees by their graduation decade and analyze which sessions appealed more to recent graduates versus older alumni.

5. **Engagement Score vs. Attendance**: Analyze if individuals with higher engagement scores attended more speaker sessions, and identify which sessions attracted highly engaged constituents.

6. **Geographic Distribution**: Map attendee locations by state/region for each session to identify geographic trends and potential locations for future in-person events.

7. **Major Field of Study Correlation**: Analyze if certain speaker topics attracted more attendees from related academic disciplines (based on their major field).

## Giving Analysis

8. **Session Attendance and Giving Correlation**: Compare giving patterns of attendees across different sessions to determine which sessions attracted the most generous donors.

9. **Pre/Post Attendance Giving Analysis**: For multi-year attendees, analyze if giving increased after attending specific speaker series events.

10. **Wealth Range Distribution by Session**: Compare the wealth estimate ranges (WE Range) of attendees across different sessions to identify which sessions attracted the wealthiest constituents.

11. **Session-Specific ROI**: Calculate the "return on investment" for each session by measuring total giving from attendees compared to potential event costs.

12. **First-Time Donor Acquisition**: Identify which sessions were most effective at attracting first-time donors who hadn't given previously.

13. **Giving Method Preferences**: If gift type data is available, analyze whether attendees of certain sessions prefer certain giving methods (e.g., online, check, recurring).

14. **Annual Fund vs. Designated Giving Preferences**: Compare the AF vs. DG giving ratios among attendees of different sessions to identify if certain topics inspire more restricted or unrestricted giving.

15. **Class Year Giving Patterns**: Analyze if certain class years or decades show stronger giving responses to specific speaker topics.

## Targeting & Outreach Opportunities

16. **"Never Attended" High-Capacity Prospects**: Identify high-capacity donors/prospects (based on Internal Gift Capacity and WE Range) who haven't attended any sessions for targeted outreach.

17. **Spousal Engagement Analysis**: Analyze patterns of couples attending together versus individually, and identify opportunities to increase spousal engagement.

18. **Ask Amount Optimization**: Compare actual giving versus the Hi/Med/Low ask amounts for attendees to determine if ask amounts are properly calibrated for this audience.

19. **Professional Affiliation Clusters**: Identify clusters of attendees from similar professional backgrounds (using CnPrBs_Org_Name and CnPrBs_Position) to discover industry-specific networking opportunities.

20. **Non-Donor Attendee Analysis**: Analyze characteristics of attendees who have never made a gift to identify barriers to giving or new engagement pathways.

21. **Email Engagement Segments**: Create email engagement segments based on attendance patterns to tailor future communications about similar events.

22. **Attendance Frequency Prediction**: Build a predictive model to identify which constituents are most likely to attend multiple events based on demographic and giving data.

## Session-Specific Insights

23. **Wendie Malik Session Analysis**: Analyze the unique characteristics of the 269 attendees at this session (the largest group) to understand what made this session particularly appealing.

24. **Karlyn Crowley Impact Assessment**: Compare giving before and after the Karlyn Crowley session to measure if this session had a measurable impact on philanthropic behavior.

25. **2024 Women in Politics Audience**: Analyze the demographic profile, giving capacity, and engagement metrics of those who attended this session to inform future political-themed events.

26. **Small Session Value**: Evaluate whether the smaller sessions (like Jordane Wells with 40 attendees) resulted in more meaningful engagement or giving despite lower attendance.

27. **Session Name Analysis**: Analyze if descriptive session names ("No More Hiding") attract different audiences than speaker-named sessions.

## Multi-Year Trend Analysis

28. **Fiscal Year Giving Patterns**: For repeat attendees, analyze their giving patterns across fiscal years (2014-2019) to identify long-term trends and the impact of continued engagement.

29. **Lifetime Giving Trajectory**: Chart the lifetime giving trajectories of frequent attendees versus one-time attendees to quantify the long-term value of speaker series engagement.

30. **Session Interest Evolution**: For individuals who attended sessions across multiple years, analyze how their interests evolved based on session topics they chose to attend.

## Implementation Recommendations

For each analysis idea, consider:

- Creating visualizations (charts, graphs, maps) to effectively communicate findings
- Segmenting results by relevant demographic factors (class year, geographic location, giving capacity)
- Developing actionable recommendations based on findings
- Incorporating results into future event planning and fundraising strategies

This comprehensive analysis will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the WOW Speaker Series in engaging and cultivating donors, while identifying specific opportunities for future programming and outreach.
